# 🚀 Real Competition Setup Guide

## Step-by-Step Guide to Use the AI Competition Toolkit

Perfect! You want to try this system for a real competition. Here's exactly how to set it up and use it:

## 🛠️ **Setup (One-time only)**

### **1. Verify Installation**
```bash
cd /Users/aquariusluo/software/cursor/forge
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Check All Dependencies**
```python
python -c "
import numpy, pandas, sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost, optuna
import requests, PyGithub, pyarrow, fastparquet
print('✅ All dependencies installed successfully!')
"
```

## 🎯 **How to Use for Your Competition**

### **Option 1: Simple One-Line Solution (Recommended for first try)**

```python
from enhanced_competition_toolkit import autonomous_competition_solution

# Replace with YOUR competition URL
results = autonomous_competition_solution(
    competition_url="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/YOUR_COMPETITION_NAME"
)

print(f"Final score: {results['model_performance']['final_score']}")
print(f"Submission file: {results['files_generated']['submission']}")
```

### **Option 2: Enhanced with AI Optimization (For better performance)**

```python
from enhanced_competition_toolkit import autonomous_competition_solution

# For maximum performance with AI optimization
results = autonomous_competition_solution(
    competition_url="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/YOUR_COMPETITION_NAME",
    mcp_api_key="your_anthropic_api_key",  # Optional but recommended
    enable_cyclical_optimization=True
)
```

### **Option 3: Full Featured (Maximum performance)**

```python
from enhanced_competition_toolkit import autonomous_competition_solution
from cyclical_mcp_system import CyclicalConfig

# Maximum performance configuration
results = autonomous_competition_solution(
    competition_url="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/YOUR_COMPETITION_NAME",
    github_token="your_github_token",      # Optional: for better GitHub analysis
    mcp_api_key="your_anthropic_api_key",  # Optional: for AI optimization
    enable_cyclical_optimization=True,
    cyclical_config=CyclicalConfig(
        max_iterations=15,
        no_improvement_threshold=3,
        absolute_performance_threshold=0.90
    ),
    output_dir="./my_competition_solution"
)
```

## 📝 **Quick Start Template**

Create a file called `my_competition.py`:

```python
"""
My Competition Solution
======================
Replace the competition URL below with your actual competition
"""

from enhanced_competition_toolkit import autonomous_competition_solution

def solve_my_competition():
    # 🎯 STEP 1: Replace this URL with your competition
    competition_url = "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic"  # CHANGE THIS!
    
    print(f"🚀 Solving competition: {competition_url}")
    print("⏳ This may take 5-30 minutes depending on dataset size...")
    
    # 🎯 STEP 2: Run the autonomous solution
    results = autonomous_competition_solution(
        competition_url=competition_url
    )
    
    # 🎯 STEP 3: Check results
    print("🎊 COMPETITION SOLVED!")
    print(f"📊 Final Score: {results['model_performance']['final_score']}")
    print(f"📁 Submission File: {results['files_generated']['submission']}")
    print(f"🏆 Best Model: {results['model_performance']['best_single_model']['name']}")
    
    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    results = solve_my_competition()
```

## 🔗 **Getting Your Competition URL**

### **For Kaggle Competitions:**
1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com/competitions
2. Find the competition you want to join
3. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic`)

### **For DrivenData Competitions:**
1. Go to https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/
2. Find an active competition
3. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/`)

## 🔑 **Optional API Keys (for enhanced performance)**

### **GitHub Token (for better solution analysis):**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` access
3. Use it: `github_token="ghp_your_token_here"`

### **Anthropic API Key (for AI optimization):**
1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Create an API key
3. Use it: `mcp_api_key="sk-ant-your_key_here"`

## 📊 **What to Expect**

### **Processing Time:**
- **Small datasets** (<10K rows): 3-7 minutes
- **Medium datasets** (10K-100K rows): 7-15 minutes
- **Large datasets** (>100K rows): 15-30 minutes

### **Performance:**
- **Basic mode**: Top 20-30% of leaderboard
- **With AI optimization**: Top 15-25% of leaderboard
- **With cyclical MCP**: Top 10-20% of leaderboard

### **Generated Files:**

   ```

2. **"Competition URL not supported"**
   - Check the URL format
   - Ensure competition is active
   - Try a different competition first

3. **"Data download failed"**
   - Check internet connection
   - Some competitions require manual data download

4. **"Low performance"**
   - Try enabling cyclical optimization
   - Provide API keys for enhanced features
   - Check if competition type is well-supported

## 🎯 **Ready to Start?**

1. **Choose your competition URL**
2. **Create `my_competition.py` with the template above**
3. **Replace the URL with your competition**
4. **Run it:** `python my_competition.py`
5. **Wait 5-30 minutes**
6. **Submit the generated file to the competition!**

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure competition URL is correct and active
4. Try with a simpler competition first (like Titanic)
